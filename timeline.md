| 4:30 pm  | I forgot my phone after our meeting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | ![FacePalm](/assets/img/facepalm.gif)     |
| 8:45 pm  | Tandoor and Tap Returns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ![NoRagrets](/assets/img/noragrets.gif)   |
| 9:22 pm  | Watched Aubree do one of her dance  routines and got a big hug from her. Put a big smile on my face.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | ![LoveYouToo](/assets/img/loveYouToo.gif) |
| 11:36 pm | Nini is mad because she tried to say she's the reason I found my phone and I told her she wasn't. It caused a big argument which evolved into how I'm childish,  an asshole, and lazy because I asked if she needed  help with getting stuff out of the car. I stood my  ground and told her to not talk to me that way. She literally could not handle that.  | ![WTF](/assets/img/wtf.gif)               |

| 11:11 am | I woke up late and didn't want to put my phone on the charger. Feeling  very lazy.                                                                                                                                           | ![lazy](/assets/img/lazy.gif)        |
| 11:30 am | My brother called. Had a good chat.                                                                                                                                                                                          | ![bro](/assets/img/bro.gif)          |
| 1:30 pm  | Decided to go to Wal-Mart. it was Christmas Eve...                                                                                                                                                                         | ![crazypills](/assets/img/crazy.gif) |
| 6:05 pm  | Nini decided to let the kids open presents and also put the Santa gift for Ivey under the tree. Of course it was opened.                                                                                                     | ![sigh](/assets/img/sigh.gif)        |
| 7:05 pm  | An argument started because I told Nini that she did not have to pay me back for borrowing money for rent. Apparently I was supposed to know that she did not plan on paying me back because she bought some of the presents. | ![waitWhat](/assets/img/wait.gif)    |

| 7:30 am  | Woken up by excited kids. I was actually dreaming but can't remember any of it.  Disappointed I couldn't remember it for  some reason.                                                                           | ![remember](/assets/img/remember.gif) |
| 8:30 am  | Watching the kids open presents. Glad they  were happy and seemed excited about their gifts.                                                                                                                     | ![presents](/assets/img/presents.gif) |
| 11:00 am | Set up Jacob's new Monitor. He was super happy.                                                                                                                                                                  | ![coding](/assets/img/coding.gif)     |
| 1:30 pm  | So tired. Took a nap.                                                                                                                                                                                            | ![nap](/assets/img/nap.gif)           |
| 6:30 pm  | Talked to my brother. Had a good chat. Sounds like Christmas was terrible and I made the right choice with not going. Was amused by my gif collection and told him about it. Showed him the Tandoor and Tap one. | ![created](/assets/img/created.gif)   |
| 10:00 pm | Texted my friend John. Told him about the new Arkham  Horror deck I made. Got input on what he wants to play. Figured out my deck name while texting with him. It's  hilarious.                                  | ![laugh](/assets/img/laugh.gif)       |

| 12:30 am | Watching a movie with Nini. She leaves before the movie is over. Was on her phone the whole time. Wants me to cuddle. I wanted to do more than that, but she  wasn't in the mood. Went downstairs to sleep on the  couch like always. I don't know why I did that or what I was expecting.  | ![huh](/assets/img/huh.gif)           |
| 2:00 am  | I decided it's time to talk to Nini about mediation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ![yeah](/assets/img/yeah.gif)         |
| 9:15 am  | Woke up startled. Not sure why. Had a feeling of dread. Pretty sure I'm just not happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | ![startled](/assets/img/startled.gif) |
| 9:45 am  | I'm just sad and tired of everything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ![tired](/assets/img/tired.gif)       |
| 11:45 am | My mom wants to visit with the kids. She's being a little  overbearing and keeps pushing to do what she wants. Just  frustrated with trying to deal with that while I'm trying  to focus on something else.                                                                                 | ![hard](/assets/img/hard.gif)         |
| 5:00 pm  | I realized that Nini disagrees with anything I say. Trying  to buy a gift for my mom and if I offered any suggestion it  was immediately rejected without consideration.                                                                                                                    | ![ohMyGod](/assets/img/ohMyGod.gif)   |
| 7:15 pm  | Pretty boring at my moms house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ![bored](/assets/img/bored.gif)       |
| 10:00 pm | Watching The Witcher with Nini. I realized I don't want to do this  or be here.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ![beHere](/assets/img/beHere.gif)     |
