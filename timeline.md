| 9:22 pm  | Watched Aubree do one of her dance  routines and got a big hug from her. Put a big smile on my face.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | ![LoveYouToo](/assets/img/loveYouToo.gif) |
| 11:36 pm | Nini is mad because she tried to say she's the reason I found my phone and I told her she wasn't. It caused a big argument which evolved into how I'm childish,  an asshole, and lazy because I asked if she needed  help with getting stuff out of the car. I stood my  ground and told her to not talk to me that way. She literally could not handle that.  | ![WTF](/assets/img/wtf.gif)               |

| 11:11 am | I woke up late and didn't want to put my phone on the charger. Feeling  very lazy.                                                                                                                                           | ![lazy](/assets/img/lazy.gif)        |
| 11:30 am | My brother called. Had a good chat.                                                                                                                                                                                          | ![bro](/assets/img/bro.gif)          |
| 1:30 pm  | Decided to go to Wal-Mart. it was Christmas Eve.....                                                                                                                                                                         | ![crazypills](/assets/img/crazy.gif) |
| 6:05 pm  | Nini decided to let the kids open presents and also put the Santa gift for Ivey under the tree. Of course it was opened.                                                                                                     | ![sigh](/assets/img/sigh.gif)        |
| 7:05 pm  | An argument started because I told Nini that she did not have to pay me back for borrowing money for rent. Apparently I was supposed to know that she did not plan on paying me back because she bought some of the presents | ![waitWhat](/assets/img/wait.gif)    |
