| 8:45 pm  | Tandoor and Tap Returns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ![NoRagrets](/assets/img/noragrets.gif)   |
| 9:22 pm  | Watched Aubree do one of her dance  routines and got a big hug from her. Put a big smile on my face.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | ![LoveYouToo](/assets/img/loveYouToo.gif) |
| 11:36 pm | Nini is mad because she tried to say she's the reason I found my phone and I told her she wasn't. It caused a big argument which evolved into how I'm childish,  an asshole, and lazy because I asked if she needed  help with getting stuff out of the car. I stood my  ground and told her to not talk to me that way. She literally could not handle that.  | ![WTF](/assets/img/wtf.gif)               |

| 11:11 am | I woke up late and didn't want to put my phone on the charger. Feeling  very lazy.                                                                                                                                           | ![lazy](/assets/img/lazy.gif)        |

| 1:30 pm  | Decided to go to Wal-Mart. it was Christmas Eve...                                                                                                                                                                         | ![crazypills](/assets/img/crazy.gif) |
| 6:05 pm  | Nini decided to let the kids open presents and also put the Santa gift for Ivey under the tree. Of course it was opened.                                                                                                     | ![sigh](/assets/img/sigh.gif)        |
| 7:05 pm  | An argument started because I told Nini that she did not have to pay me back for borrowing money for rent. Apparently I was supposed to know that she did not plan on paying me back because she bought some of the presents. | ![waitWhat](/assets/img/wait.gif)    |

| 7:30 am  | Woken up by excited kids. I was actually dreaming but can't remember any of it.  Disappointed I couldn't remember it for  some reason.                                                                           | ![remember](/assets/img/remember.gif) |
| 8:30 am  | Watching the kids open presents. Glad they  were happy and seemed excited about their gifts.                                                                                                                     | ![presents](/assets/img/presents.gif) |
| 11:00 am | Set up Jacob's new Monitor. He was super happy.                                                                                                                                                                  | ![coding](/assets/img/coding.gif)     |
| 1:30 pm  | So tired. Took a nap.                                                                                                                                                                                            | ![nap](/assets/img/nap.gif)           |
| 6:30 pm  | Talked to my brother. Had a good chat. Sounds like Christmas was terrible and I made the right choice with not going. Was amused by my gif collection and told him about it. Showed him the Tandoor and Tap one. | ![created](/assets/img/created.gif)   |
| 10:00 pm | Texted my friend John. Told him about the new Arkham  Horror deck I made. Got input on what he wants to play. Figured out my deck name while texting with him. It's  hilarious.                                  | ![laugh](/assets/img/laugh.gif)       |

| 12:30 am | Watching a movie with Nini. She leaves before the movie is over. Was on her phone the whole time. Wants me to cuddle. I wanted to do more than that, but she  wasn't in the mood. Went downstairs to sleep on the  couch like always. I don't know why I did that or what I was expecting.  | ![huh](/assets/img/huh.gif)           |
| 2:00 am  | I decided it's time to talk to Nini about mediation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | ![yeah](/assets/img/yeah.gif)         |
| 9:15 am  | Woke up startled. Not sure why. Had a feeling of dread. Pretty sure I'm just not happy.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | ![startled](/assets/img/startled.gif) |
| 9:45 am  | I'm just sad and tired of everything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | ![tired](/assets/img/tired.gif)       |
| 11:45 am | My mom wants to visit with the kids. She's being a little  overbearing and keeps pushing to do what she wants. Just  frustrated with trying to deal with that while I'm trying  to focus on something else.                                                                                 | ![hard](/assets/img/hard.gif)         |
| 5:00 pm  | I realized that Nini disagrees with anything I say. Trying  to buy a gift for my mom and if I offered any suggestion it  was immediately rejected without consideration.                                                                                                                    | ![ohMyGod](/assets/img/ohMyGod.gif)   |
| 7:15 pm  | Pretty boring at my moms house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ![bored](/assets/img/bored.gif)       |
| 10:00 pm | Watching The Witcher with Nini. I realized I don't want to do this  or be here.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | ![beHere](/assets/img/beHere.gif)     |

| 2:00 am  | Had sex with Nini. Couldn't sleep and went  to the couch. Really dissapointed with myself.                                                                            | ![notAgain](/assets/img/notAgain.gif)       |
| 12:30 pm | Had a conversation with Nini about mediation.  She has put 0 thought into this whole situation.                                                                      | ![itsDone](/assets/img/itsDone.gif)         |
| 2:00 pm  | Still arguing since bringing up mediation. So  tired of being blamed for everything. I know I'm  not perfect, but seriously?                                         | ![overIt](/assets/img/overIt.gif)           |
| 3:00 pm  | Took the trash out and went to Wal-Mart to buy a  record I wanted. Felt like treating myself.                                                                        | ![treatyoself](/assets/img/treatYoSelf.gif) |
| 4:00 pm  | Took Jacob to the doctor's office. Nini wanted to  put him on medication for his behavior. I was not  having that.                                                   | ![no](/assets/img/no.gif)                   |
| 5:50 pm  | Took the family to dinner. Got a few appitizers and  boy was it expensive. Don't regret it because the  kids had fun.                                                | ![escalated](/assets/img/escalated.gif)     |
| 8:00 pm  | Nini thought about it and wants to do couples therapy.  I.. I don't know how I feel about that. Seems like  talking about mediation made her think about everything. | ![confused](/assets/img/confused.gif)       |
| 11:30 pm | Ivey couldn't sleep and we hung out in my office listening  to my new record. I showed her all of my keepsakes and it  was great to reminiscence with her.           | ![behold](/assets/img/behold.gif)           |

| 12:30 am | Saw text from Nini to her sister. Nini only gives her sister a skewed  and warped story of events. Blames me for everything and makes it seem  like I'm a terrible vindictive person.                                               | ![notMad](/assets/img/NotMad.gif)   |
| 3:00 am  | Couldn't sleep. I've been waiting for the Boba Fett show to come out  and watched it when it released.. at 3:00 am in the morning.                                                                                                  | ![boba](/assets/img/boba.gif)       |
| 1:00 pm  | So tired..                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | ![tired](/assets/img/sotired.gif)   |
| 3:30 pm  | I ate Nini's left over pizza at 4:00 am. I intended to tell her and buy her  lunch. Forgot I did that and now she is pissed. Offered to buy her lunch or  order a new pizza but she doesn't want that. I shouldn't have done that.  | ![whoops](/assets/img/whoops.gif)   |
| 4:00 pm  | Threw the ball with Ivey. She's really improving!                                                                                                                                                                                   | ![sandlot](/assets/img/sandlot.gif) |
| 5:00 pm  | Worked with Aubree and her new science kit.                                                                                                                                                                                         | ![science](/assets/img/science.gif) |

| Time     | Explination                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Emotion/Reaction                            |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 3:47 am  | Can't sleep. Nini posted on Facebook acting  like she set up the painting session. All I can  think of is how she  pretends I don't exists on  social media while still wanting me to treat her  like we're still in a relationship and my wife. | ![whale](/assets/img/whale.gif)             |
| 12:00 pm | Got haircuts with Jacob. What a dapper young  gentleman he is.                                                                                                                                                                                   | ![lookingGood](/assets/img/lookingGood.gif) |
| 3:00 pm  | Nini thought I was going to her sisters for New  Years. I talked to her a week prior to it about  going out with friends. She literally set up a  New Years party with her sister and excluded me  from it, but now expected me to go.           | ![notAgain](/assets/img/shitAgain.gif)      |
| 4:00 pm  | Took Ivey to get her nails done. She's growing up  so fast!                                                                                                                                                                                      | ![nails](/assets/img/nails.gif)             |
| 4:30 pm  | Got a complement on my haircut. Feels really good  getting a positive comment. What's this.. seems..  seems I've got something in my eye.                                                                                                        | ![thanks](/assets/img/thanks.gif)           |
| 7:00 pm  | Dressed up for New Years. Going to a friends house.  Nini is mad, but I don't care. Feeling good about  myself.                                                                                                                                  | ![fancy](/assets/img/fancy.gif)             |
| 8:00 pm  | Walked in to my friends house. Greeted with a warm  welcome and everyone commented on how good I looked.  Feels nice to have positive feedback.                                                                                                  | ![ohStop](/assets/img/ohStop.gif)           |

| 12:31 am | Ivey texted me she had her first period.  I was freaked out a little, but told her  it's OK and that she's awesome. Guess we're  starting 2022 out with a bang.  | ![omg](/assets/img/omg.gif)                 |
| 11:00 am | Nini is upset with me. Says I choose my  friends over my family. Now I'm getting the  silent treatment. I don't give a shit.                                     | ![dontcare](/assets/img/dontcare.gif)       |

| 3:30 pm  | Taught Aubree how to ride her bike without  training wheels.                                                                                                     | ![mygirl](/assets/img/mygirl.gif)           |

| 10:00 pm | A friend of a friend is flirting with me (maybe  I don't know). Anyway, nice to think I still have it  even if she is just being nice.                           | ![excited](/assets/img/excited.gif)         |
